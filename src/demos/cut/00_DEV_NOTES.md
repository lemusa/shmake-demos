## How to use these notes
- Broken beats planned, always
- Global issues take priority over module work
- If something is fixed, delete the note
- If it’s a rule, it never lives in module lists

🔴GLOBAL ISSUES🔴
	🟢 Happy days at the moment
	🔵 Add timber type filters
	🔵 Integrate images to app and pdf exports

## GENERAL
    🔴 Need to show an error when a required cut is longer than the cut limit - and how to handle it
	🔵 Add option for store to cut at X$

## FENCING
    🟢 Works great
    🔵 Add option for concrete required (3 bags per hole?)
	🔵 Add option for fasteners required

## WALLS
    🔴 Changing the maximum length after calculating won't allow re-calculating with that length limitation. A session cache issue? - can't replicate it.
	🔴 Did have an unresponsive crash - screenshot
	🔴 The extra calculating messages didn't show.
	🔵 Add option for wall covering

## DECKING
    🔵 Not started
 
## ADMIN
    🔵 How do users access it?
	🔴 PDF branding image is too big
