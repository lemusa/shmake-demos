# How to Use the Cutting Calculator

This calculator helps you work out how many lengths of timber you need to buy for your project. Enter the cuts you need, and it will figure out the most efficient way to cut them from standard stock lengths — minimising waste and saving you money.

## Step 1: Select Your Timber

Use the tabs at the top to pick a category (Framing, Decking, Fencing, etc.), then choose the specific product from the dropdown. The calculator will automatically load the available stock lengths and pricing for that product.

If your product isn't listed, select **Custom** and enter your own stock lengths manually.

## Step 2: Enter Your Required Cuts

Under **Required Cuts**, enter each length you need and how many of each. For example, if you're building a deck frame and need four pieces at 2400mm and six at 1200mm, add two rows:

| Length | Qty |
|--------|-----|
| 2400   | 4   |
| 1200   | 6   |

You can also **Import** a cut list by pasting from a spreadsheet or uploading a CSV file.

## Step 3: Calculate

Click the **Calculate** button. The calculator will optimise how your cuts are arranged across the available stock lengths to minimise waste.

## Reading the Results

**Summary bar** — Shows total pieces cut, overall material efficiency (higher is better), usable offcuts, and scrap.

**Stock Required** — How many of each stock length you need to purchase. This is your shopping list.

**Cutting Plan** — A visual breakdown of each stock piece showing:
- **Green segments** — Your cuts
- **Dark segments** — Saw kerf (blade width lost per cut)
- **Amber segments** — Usable offcuts (long enough to keep for another project)
- **Red segments** — Scrap (too short to be useful)

## Optional: Costing

Toggle **Costing** on to see estimated material costs based on the price per metre. You can also set a cost per cut if your supplier charges for cutting.

## Optional: PDF Export

Click **Export PDF** to download a printable cutting plan. Bring this to the counter so staff can cut your timber to the plan.

## Settings

Click the gear icon to adjust:
- **Units** — Switch between millimetres, metres, inches, or feet
- **Saw Kerf** — Blade width (typically 3mm for a circular saw)
- **Min Offcut** — Shortest offcut worth keeping (anything shorter is counted as scrap)
- **End Trim** — If your stock has unusable ends (e.g. damaged or stamped ends), enter the amount to trim per end

## Tips for Better Results

- **Enter all your cuts at once** rather than calculating one wall at a time. The optimiser works best when it can combine cuts from different parts of your project.
- **Use the Import feature** if you have a large cut list from your plans.
- **Check the offcuts** — if you're getting large usable offcuts, consider whether you can use those lengths elsewhere in your project.
- **Round up, not down** — it's always better to have a little extra than to come up short. Add a small margin to your measurements if in doubt.
