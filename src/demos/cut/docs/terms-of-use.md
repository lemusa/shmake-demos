# shmakeCut — Terms of Use & Disclaimer

*Last updated: February 2026*

## 1. Nature of the Service

shmakeCut provides an online cutting calculator tool ("the Tool") designed to assist users in estimating timber cutting plans and material quantities. The Tool is provided as a planning aid only.

## 2. Estimates Only — No Guarantee of Accuracy

All calculations, cutting plans, material quantities, and cost estimates generated by the Tool are **approximations only**. They are based on the inputs provided by the user and standard mathematical optimisation algorithms.

shmakeCut does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of any output for any particular purpose. Actual material requirements may differ from calculated estimates due to factors including but not limited to:

- Variations in timber dimensions, straightness, and quality
- Saw blade width (kerf) differences between equipment
- End damage, splits, or defects requiring additional trimming
- Cutting errors or measurement inaccuracies on site
- Changes to project scope or design after calculation
- Builder preference for additional material margin

## 3. Not Professional Advice

The Tool does not provide and is not a substitute for professional building, engineering, architectural, or trade advice. Outputs from the Tool should not be relied upon for:

- Structural adequacy or load-bearing calculations
- Compliance with the New Zealand Building Code, NZS 3604, or any other standard
- Building consent documentation
- Any purpose where incorrect quantities could cause structural failure, safety hazards, or regulatory non-compliance

Users should always consult a licensed building practitioner, engineer, or qualified tradesperson before purchasing materials for structural or consented work.

## 4. User Responsibility

Users are solely responsible for:

- The accuracy of all inputs entered into the Tool (cut lengths, quantities, stock lengths, settings)
- Verifying calculated quantities against their project requirements before purchasing
- Ensuring purchased materials meet applicable building standards and regulations
- Any decisions made based on the Tool's output

We recommend purchasing a reasonable margin of additional material (typically 5–10%) to account for cutting waste, defects, and site adjustments.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by New Zealand law, shmakeCut, its operators, and the hosting retailer accept no liability for:

- Material shortages or excess resulting from reliance on the Tool's calculations
- Financial loss from over-ordering or under-ordering materials
- Project delays caused by incorrect material estimates
- Any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the Tool
- Any claim relating to the structural adequacy of materials purchased using the Tool's output

## 6. Wholesaler Responsibility

Where the Tool is embedded on a third-party retailer's website, the retailer is responsible for ensuring the product catalogue (species, profiles, stock lengths, and pricing) loaded into the Tool is accurate and current. shmakeCut is not responsible for errors in product data provided by the retailer.

## 7. No Storage of Personal Data

The Tool does not require user accounts, collect personal information, or use tracking cookies. Aggregate usage statistics (calculation counts, efficiency metrics) are collected for service improvement and retailer reporting. No individual calculation inputs or results are stored.

## 8. Intellectual Property

The shmakeCut software, algorithms, user interface, and documentation are the intellectual property of the operator. The Tool is provided under licence to participating retailers for embedding on their websites. Unauthorised reproduction, reverse engineering, or redistribution is prohibited.

## 9. Availability

The Tool is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access and may modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time.

## 10. Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of New Zealand. Any disputes will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand courts.
